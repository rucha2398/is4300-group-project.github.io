<h1>T2: Group Assignment #2: Requirements Analysis</h1>

<p>
<b>Problem</b>
Mental health across Northeastern’s campus and almost all other colleges is an issue that is underfunded and access to resources can be confusing or complicated. This leads to lower grades, less sleep, less motivation, and an overall worse learning experience.

<b>Personas</b>
Examples of primary, secondary, tertiary and facilitating stakeholders in this project. 
<br>
<b>Primary - Undergraduate Student</b>
<br>
Name: Brian Dunham<br>
Age: 20 years old<br>
Year: 3rd year<br>
Major: Communications<br>
<br>
<b>Interests</b>
<br>
Brian really enjoys movies. He likes watching them, producing them and analyzing them. As a communications major, he really wants to work in the film industry. He really likes comedy videos and enjoys making them with his friends. They have a small show they film every week. He also really enjoys writing and sometimes wishes he had more time for it. He is very busy with his homework and studying that he doesn’t really get a lot of time for himself. 
<br>
<b>Typical Day</b>
<br>
Brian gets up before his first class which is at 11:30. He prefers to wake up late and go to bed late. He generally skips breakfast and buys his lunch at Rebeccas. He tries to get lunch with his friend Juliette at least twice a week. After his class, he’ll go back home and plan out what he wants to film later that day with his friends. The show they put on really gets him through the day and makes him feel better. Brian has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for the past couple of years. He struggles day to day with his problems, and some days are worse than others. After planning and filming, he does his homework until late at night. He generally falls asleep watching Netflix. 
<br>
<b>Tech Usage</b>
<br>
Overall, Brian uses his phone more than his laptop. He spends a lot of his day going through his twitter feed and reddit feeds. Most of the planning he does for his show is in his physical notebook. He does spend a decent amount of time on his laptop editing his videos, but his laptop is really only for work purposes. 
Future Goals
Brian really wants to get a co-op in the film industry studying how to become a director. He occasionally does stand-up at school and wants to figure out how to do that more often. He also really wants to get help in terms of his mental health. He feels very alone sometimes because it isn’t something people talk about a lot.

<b>Secondary - Undergraduate Student (friend of someone using the app)</b>
<br>
Name: Juliette Penzer<br>
Age: 20 years old<br>
Year: 3rd year<br>
Major: Graphic Design<br>
<br>
<b>Interests</b>
Juliette came to Northeastern as Computer Science student. After a year she decided to switch to graphic design after taking a couple of design classes that she really enjoyed. She has been on one co-op at a tech company on their marketing team. She is very organized and likes having her days planned. She frequently schedules every part of her day because she likes to stay on top of that. She also loves to cook and cooks in her apartment for almost every meal.
<br>
<b>Typical Day</b>
Juliette wakes up around 9am every day and goes to the gym. She’ll workout at the gym for an hour and a half before she has to go to her first class. After that class she goes home and makes herself lunch. She likes to watch youtube while eating lunch and then she’ll hangout with her roommates for an hour or so before going back to work. She does a lot of work in her room because she has a single room. She likes having a quiet space to herself while doing productive work. After a long day of work she will go to a club meeting where she is a team lead on the design team. She will critique more of her team’s work at this meeting as well as contribute to general org growth. After the meeting she eats dinner and goes home. She will plan her next day out on her notes application. 
<br>
<b>Tech Usage</b>
As a graphic design major, she uses her apple computer a lot. Mac products allow her to use a lot of the adobe suite as well as prototyping tools like Sketch. She spends around 3 hours on her laptop taking notes and another 4-5 hours doing homework every day. She watches youtube and netflix for around an hour every day as well. Juliette uses her phone but she wouldn’t say she’s obsessed. Her favorite apps include instagram and spotify. Since she has an iphone, she uses her iphone and laptop to imessage people throughout the day. 
<br>
<b>Future Goals</b>
Juliette really wants to work at a design agency. She has been working on her portfolio for the past few months. She even created her own website from scratch. It took her a while to learn a lot of the tech things to build it, but eventually got it! She is applying to more co-ops this semester but is finding it difficult to find a company that she is interested in. On top of that and her school work she is stressed but excited about her future job prospects now that she knows more about what she wants in a company.

Erica works full time at a big tech company. She generally wakes up, eats breakfast and goes to work. She is in and out of meetings but usually comes home around 5pm. She and her husband cook dinner for themselves. Both of their children are at college, so they have a lot of time to spend together. She generally calls her kids a couple times a week to check in on how they are doing. She does this before bed. 
<br>
<b>Tech Usage</b>
Erica works in tech so she is constantly on her laptop. She is a team lead for a big software project that is going out soon. She is always on her phone if she isn’t on her laptop. The only times she is tech free is when she is eating her meals and a couple hours before she goes to bed.

<b>Tasks</b>

</p>

<p>
<b>Problem Scenarios</b>

1. <b>Writing a diary entry</b>
<br>
This college student writes their diary entries on their laptop. They use their notes app on their macbook to write a couple of bullet points about their day and how they are feeling. First, they click on the daily reminder that pops up at the end of the day to write in their diary. They open their notes app to the diary folder. They make a copy of the diary writing template and start writing. After around 5 minutes of writing, they lock the note and close out of the notes application. They then check this off of their reminders. 

<br>

2. <b>Finding a mental health counselor</b>
<br>
First, this person checks on Northeastern’s health services website to try and schedule an appointment. It states that they must come in person to do this. They wake up early in the morning and go to the health office. They put their name down and say that they are looking for a mental health counselor. The administrator schedules them and tells them that they will have to wait an hour. An hour or so later, the counselor sees them. They speak for around 15 minutes for a quick first session to understand what their issues are. The counselor then refers them to a couple of different psychologists. 

<br>

3. <b>Find a mental health hotline number </b>
<br>
First, this person realizes they need help and don’t know where to go. They think back to searches about mental health and the hotlines they’ve seen over and over. They make the decision to look it up again and make the choice to click the number from their search. Their device gives them the option to call or cancel. They call the hotline and hear an automated message which quickly puts them in contact with a trained professional. This professional talks to them from a local crisis center and gives them the best advice possible. This professional will refer them to a counselor or recommend further actions to help them.

</p>

<p>
<b>Usability Requirements</b>

1. <b>It will be easy to learn how to do things and remember how to do them after a while.</b>
<br>
The User Interface of the app will have commonly used buttons and help windows to allow the user to quickly figure out how to traverse the app based on preexisting standards and norms. This will allow the user’s pre-existing knowledge to allow for a quick learning curve on how to use the app.

<br>

2. <b>It will be easily accessible to all potential users.</b>
<br>
We want to make sure this app is free so that all students can download it without an economical barrier of entry. We hope to advertise it to students through different forms of media so that it is visible to the community. Additionally, this app should be available on all phones so that every type of student can use it!
