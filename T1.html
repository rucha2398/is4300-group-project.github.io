<h1>T1: Group Assignment #1: Team Proposal</h1>

<p>
<b>Problem</b>
The main problem we are trying to solve is the lack of mental health resources on college campuses and access to resources if they exist. Currently, students have access to University Health Counseling Services, which is known to be difficult. Students have to wait in line for hours to talk to a doctor, who will then end up referring them to someone outside of Northeastern. The process is lengthy and difficult for someone who is already facing mental health problems. Additionally, there is no way for students to schedule appointments online. 
Recently, Northeastern partnered with FIND, a comprehensive mental health and wellness resource. With FIND, students can call a specialist to receive 5 free counseling sessions. This is a great resource, but many students do not know how to access it. 
Lastly, it has been studied that writing daily helps people gain control of their emotions, and in return, helps their mental health. There are few daily writing platforms, and many are outdated or have too much information.

<b>Users</b>
The intended users of this product would be students across all years at northeastern. Mental health is a very serious issue and it is often not addressed for many people especially college-age students. In college-age students, Anxiety is the top presenting concern affecting roughly 41.6% of students followed by depression 36.4% and relationship problems affecting 35.8% according to a 2018 study conducted by the American Psychological Association. While suffering from anxiety or depression learning is affected due to the fact that anxiety and depression both significantly hinder working memory, which is essential for retaining new information and recalling previously learned information. Anxiety and depression negatively influence academic progress and encourage under-achievement leading to worse grades and overall worse learning experience at northeastern. In order to test this application, we would need to use students from around the campus across different age groups to see how they use the app and if it has an overall positive effect on mental health across campus.

<b>Solution</b>
For this semester, we would like to create a mobile application that allows students better access to mental health resources as well as the ability to write daily. A mobile application will allow us to send users notifications to write daily, and write on the go. We hope that this combination is productive and beneficial for overall mental health on a college campus. We envision a place on the application where students can see mental health resources on campus as well as around the country. Additionally, students can share resources with each other. The second workflow would involve helping students develop a writing routine where they could journal daily. Currently, we are thinking of using Python and React to build the mobile application, but are open to other suggestions.
